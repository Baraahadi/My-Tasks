## ‚ùì Questions & Reflections

While working on this project, I encountered a few questions that I would appreciate guidance on:

1. **JavaScript Organization**  
   How can I properly implement JavaScript code that relates to the "About" page within the `app.js` file?

2. **Time Management**  
   What‚Äôs the best way to manage time and tasks effectively during lab-based or solo web development projects?

3. **Static Elements**  
   Is it acceptable to include non-functional, static elements in a project purely for visual or structural enhancement?

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Time & Actual Duration

Initially, based on the project instructions, I estimated that it would take **about one day** to complete.

However, my actual workflow involved:

- Refreshing knowledge of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**
- Reviewing the **DOM (Document Object Model)**
- Designing and building the final layout
- Implementing core functionality

This process took approximately **two and a half days**, as I wanted to ensure a thorough understanding and thoughtful execution of each step.
